# Deadwood Justice
This is a mini ship shooting game with a western theme. The player controls the outlaw, who must shoot enemies to survive. The enemies include a walking coffin, a cactus, and a coyote. There is also a boss wave featuring the cowboy.

The difficulty mode affects the number of enemies, the speed of the enemies, and the damage that the enemies do. The harder the difficulty, the higher the score the player earns.
- **I'M TOO CHICKEN** is the easiest difficulty mode. There are no map props and all mobs except for the boss move only from left to right.
- **HURT ME PLENTY** is the medium difficulty mode. There are more enemies, they move faster, and they do more damage. This mode is a good challenge for players who have some experience with the game.
- **NIGHTMARE** is the hardest difficulty mode. There are even more enemies, they move even faster, and they do even more damage. This mode is only for the most experienced players who are looking for a real challenge.

The player can collect power-ups to help them survive. The power-ups are:
- Lamp: Doubles the current strength of the outlaw
- Hay: Provides immortality to the outlaw for 5 seconds
- Wheel: Slows down all the enemies' movement to the minimum speed for 5 seconds
- Snake Oil: Freezes all the enemies in their current position for 5 seconds.

The game features 2D graphics, similar to the aesthetic used by old JRPGs. The player can move the outlaw in multiple directions and shoot bullets at the enemies. The enemies move towards the outlaw and will try to shoot them, depending on the chosen difficulty. The player must avoid the enemies' bullets and shoot them down before they reach the outlaw. The game ends when the outlaw's strength is depleted or when the level timer ends. The player can then start a new game.
